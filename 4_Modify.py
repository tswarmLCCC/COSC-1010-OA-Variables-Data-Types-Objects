Modify Activity 1: Prettier Printing with F-Strings

Task: The code below works, but the output is not very readable. Your goal is to modify it.

1.  Delete the three existing `print()` statements.
2.  Replace them with a SINGLE `print()` statement that uses an f-string.
3.  The output should be a single, nicely formatted sentence, like this:
    "User 'AdaLovelace' is 207 years old and works as a Programmer."
"""

# Starter Code
username = "AdaLovelace"
age = 207
occupation = "Programmer"

# TODO: Replace these three lines with one f-string print statement
print("User:")
print(username)
print("is an Programmer")
